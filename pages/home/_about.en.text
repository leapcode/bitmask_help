The *Bitmask* application and its custom branded versions like RiseupVPN are lovingly hand-crafted by a team of paid and volunteer programmers from seven different countries. Development is principally sponsored by the [[LEAP Encryption Access Project => https://leap.se]], an non-profit organization dedicated to defending democracy by *protecting the right to whisper*.

The service provider https://demo.bitmask.net is operated by LEAP in order to demonstrate usage of the *Bitmask* application. However, we actively encourage other organizations to start their own compatible service providers by using our free software [[platform for server automation => https://leap.se/en/platform]].
