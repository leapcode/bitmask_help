h2. Found a bug in the software or want to request a feature ?

Please register an account on the "LEAP issue tracker":https://0xacab.org first.

First, please "search the existing issues":https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-dev/issues to see if someone has already reported that bug.
If not, you can file a "new issue for the Bitmask client":https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask-dev/issues/new.
If you have feature requests or you've found a bug in Bitmask Android you can check our "Android issue tracker":https://0xacab.org/leap/bitmask_android/issues.


h2. Get support from your provider

For questions related to your service, and not the Bitmask software, you will need to contact your service provider directly. Here are links to some of the popular service providers that support Bitmask:

* [[riseup.net -> https://black.riseup.net]]
